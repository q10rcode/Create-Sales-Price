# Create-Sales-Price
This program was created to demonstrate the use of selection as a programming structure.
The program will ask users questions about the order and then will create an invoice showing different charges.
The program also applies rate like extra charges for weight and for sales tax depending on the county chosen.
For this program ( Orange county, San Diego county, and Los Angelos county are the only valid choices).
